<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Doctor of Engineering candidate supervised by [**Prof. Jiming Chen**](https://person.zju.edu.cn/jmchen), [**Prof. Shibo He**](https://person.zju.edu.cn/shibohe/683161.html), and [Asst.Prof. Chaojie Gu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/gucj) at Zhejiang University, China. 
I received my Master of Engineering degree with the College of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Fuzhou University supervised by [Prof. Zhezhuang Xu](https://dqxy.fzu.edu.cn/info/1010/3365.htm).

My research interests cover Industrial Internet of Things (e.g., OPC UA), Intelligent Production Scheduling, and Artificial Intelligence applications in the industrial manufacturing field (e.g., Reinforcement Learning and Large Language Models).
My current research projects mainly focus on LLM/DRL-based data collection, resource optimization, and production scheduling within multi-objective, dynamic interference, and complex (i.e., large-scale and distributed collaboration) industrial discrete manufacturing environments.

I have published 10+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l-zF-W0AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FRKWin93%2FRKWin93.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top journal such as TII, IoTJ, JAS, etc..

<!-- CDN jsDelivr来远程访问我的git的citation的分支的json文件进行显示。注意对链接URL进行编码。citation的分支是按照readme指导完成。在此repo的setting里边的secret的action选项中new repo secret新建谷歌学术ID变量，然后enable repo的action，自动在main分支中新建分支进行更新 -->

<!--
Configure the google scholar citation crawler:
Find your google scholar ID in the url of your google scholar page (e.g., https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SCHOLAR_ID), where SCHOLAR_ID is your google scholar ID.
Set GOOGLE_SCHOLAR_ID variable to your google scholar ID in Settings -> Secrets -> Actions -> New repository secret of the REPO website with name=GOOGLE_SCHOLAR_ID and value=SCHOLAR_ID.
Click the Action of the REPO website and enable the workflows by clicking "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them". This github action will generate google scholar citation stats data gs_data.json in google-scholar-stats branch of your REPO. When you update your main branch, this action will be triggered. This action will also be trigger 08:00 UTC everyday.
